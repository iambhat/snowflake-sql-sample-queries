-- Use Case: Data Aggregation and Reporting

/*
Imagine you work for a retail company that operates in multiple regions, and you're responsible for generating weekly sales reports for each region.
To streamline this process and improve efficiency, you decide to create a stored procedure in Snowflake to automate the aggregation of sales data and generate these reports.

1. Objective: 
   - Automate the aggregation of weekly sales data and generate reports for different regions.

2. Stored Procedure Creation:
   - Create a stored procedure named `GenerateWeeklySalesReport` that takes parameters like `start_date`, `end_date`, and `region`.

3. Procedure Logic:
   - Upon invoking the `GenerateWeeklySalesReport` procedure with the specified parameters, it initiates the process.
   - The procedure fetches sales data from the `Sales` table for the specified `start_date`, `end_date`, and `region`.
   - It aggregates this data by summing up sales amounts for each product category or specific criteria as required.

4. Actions:
   - Generate a report containing aggregated sales data for the specified region and time frame.
   - Insert this report into a dedicated `SalesReports` table, tagging it with the region and date for reference.
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging in case of any issues during the report generation process.

5. Sample Stored Procedure Code:
*/

   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GenerateWeeklySalesReport(start_date DATE, end_date DATE, region VARCHAR)
   RETURNS STRING
   LANGUAGE SQL
   AS
   $$
   BEGIN
     INSERT INTO SalesReports (report_date, region, total_sales)
     SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', sales_date) AS week_start_date,
            :region AS region,
            SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
     FROM Sales
     WHERE sales_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
       AND region = :region
     GROUP BY week_start_date, region;
     
     RETURN 'Weekly sales report generated successfully for ' || :region || '.';
   EXCEPTION
     WHEN OTHERS THEN
       RETURN 'Error generating the weekly sales report for ' || :region || ': ' || ERROR_MESSAGE();
   END;
   $$;

/*
6. Execution:
   - To generate a weekly sales report for a specific region and time frame, call the stored procedure `GenerateWeeklySalesReport` with the `start_date`, `end_date`, and `region` parameters.
   - Example: `CALL GenerateWeeklySalesReport('2023-12-01', '2023-12-07', 'North America');`

7. Benefits:
   - **Efficiency**: Automates the process of generating weekly sales reports, saving time and effort.
   - **Consistency**: Ensures consistent report formatting and data aggregation.
   - **Scalability**: Easily scalable to generate reports for different regions and time frames.
